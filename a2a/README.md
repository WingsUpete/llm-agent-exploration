# Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol

Here we dive into the [A2A protocol](https://google.github.io/A2A/) introduced by Google. Check the official GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/google/A2A) as well.

There is also [an official demo](https://github.com/google/A2A/tree/main/samples/python/agents/langgraph) that integrates this protocol with LangGraph.
