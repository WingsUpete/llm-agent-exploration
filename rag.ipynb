Elden Ring is a pretty popular action RPG with a lot of content and various resources available online, like guides and walkthroughs. The user mentioned that they're maintaining a knowledge base using some local files, which probably include this text chunk from the guide.\n",

      "Wait, there was an article or a comment somewhere that mentioned a producer for the soundtrack before the actual composer came on board. The person who produced it might have been someone with experience both in music and games, possibly someone like Raimer TFFF. Oh right! Raimer is also known as Raimar The sandata guy. I think he's done some other game soundtracks and worked closely with the developers.\n",
